Hello, please note, that this plugin was created with speed and efficiency in mind. I didn't include anything other than what was specified in the document. 
This is due to the limited time I had, and the unfortunate timing of the email reuesting this trial plugin. 
I would like to say that I usually am more creative and like to add more than expected. 
But, although it is rare, I was very busy this week with an online course (now over) and I had little spare time. 
I want to also make it clear that I will be able to dedicate a lot more time than I did to this plugin. Again, it was just bad timing.
